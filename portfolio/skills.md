## AI / LLM Tooling & Vibe Coding
| Tool / Skill | Experience | Context |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Claude Code (Anthropic) | Daily driver | Primary coding agent — project scaffolding, refactoring, multi-file edits, debugging. Run as worker agents with custom SOUL.md personalities |
| OpenCode | Active | Self-hosted coding agent on BLACKSTAR (RTX 4090), HTTP API orchestration, session management |
| Cursor / Windsurf | Familiar | AI-first IDE usage for rapid prototyping |
| AI Agent Orchestration | Advanced | Built custom agent with 30+ skills, multi-device orchestration, knowledge graphs, proactive monitoring |
| LangChain / LangGraph | Working | Agent workflows, graph-based pipelines |
| LangFuse | Active | LLM observability, tracing, prompt evaluation |
| Prompt Engineering | Advanced | System prompts, few-shot, chain-of-thought, tool-use patterns |
| RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) | Working | Vector search (Pinecone at Trax), embedding pipelines |
| OpenAI API / Anthropic API | Daily | GPT-4/5, Claude Opus/Sonnet, streaming, function calling, vision |
| Whisper (OpenAI) | Working | Audio transcription integration |
| ElevenLabs | Working | TTS integration, voice cloning |
| MCP (Model Context Protocol) | Familiar | Tool server architecture for AI agents |
| SearXNG | Active | Self-hosted meta-search for AI pipelines (MegaSearch project) |
| Supabase + Edge Functions | Active | AI-powered backends (serve_ai project) |
| FastAPI + Dramatiq | Active | LLM worker pipelines, async task queues |
| Ontology / Knowledge Graphs | Active | JSONL-based entity graphs for structured agent memory |
| Vibe Coding | Daily practice | End-to-end app development via AI agents — prompting > typing |

**Philosophy:** Code is increasingly a conversation. I design systems where AI agents do the heavy lifting while I focus on architecture, product decisions, and quality gates. Built a full AI agent ecosystem (Rollo 🦝) that manages smart home, monitors flights, trades on prediction markets, orchestrates coding tasks across 5 machines, and maintains its own knowledge graph.
