    "text": "I had the pleasure to work and manage Andrey directly on two separate projects. One was pure iOS app development gig, another a much more complex iOS framework requiring deep iOS system understanding. Even though Andrey did not have the required expertise at the time, he was not afraid of the challenge, stepped out of his comfort zone and quickly ramped up and became the main expert in a team on all things iOS. Andrey is a fast learner, very methodical in his work and is a pleasure to work with overall."
