Andrey is the kind of person that is rare to find and worth to work with. We worked together in a global project and he was always able to handle the pressure of the project without losing his kind and good mood. We had technical, culture and communication challenges and his behavior allowed us to achieve our goals. He is a very skilled guy and was able to handle situations out of his comfort zone with excellence. A great person!

## Dmitry Fink
**Software Engineer at Oculus VR / Facebook**
*August 2023 — managed Andrey directly*

I had the pleasure to work and manage Andrey directly on two separate projects. One was pure iOS app development gig, another a much more complex iOS framework requiring deep iOS system understanding. Even though Andrey did not have the required expertise at the time, he was not afraid of the challenge, stepped out of his comfort zone and quickly ramped up and became the main expert in a team on all things iOS. Andrey is a fast learner, very methodical in his work and is a pleasure to work with overall.
